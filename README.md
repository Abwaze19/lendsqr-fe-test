#lendsqr-fe-test

This project is a web application for Lendsqr, likely a financial services or lending platform. The application consists of four main pages:

1. Login Page: Allows users to authenticate and access the system.

2. Dashboard: Provides an overview of key metrics and user statistics.

3. User List Page: Displays a list of users (500 records) with search and filter functionality.

4. User Details Page: Shows detailed information for individual users, with the ability to view and edit user data.

Key technical aspects:

- Built using React with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
- Utilizes SCSS for advanced styling capabilities.
- Implements responsive design to ensure usability across desktop and mobile devices.
- Uses local storage or IndexedDB for client-side data persistence, particularly for user details.
- Integrates with a mock API to simulate backend interactions for user data.

The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development practices, including:

- Component-based architecture
- State management
- API integration
- Responsive design
- Form handling and validation
- Data persistence
- TypeScript usage in a React environment

This application would typically be used by administrators or customer service representatives to manage user accounts, view user information, and potentially make changes to user data within the Lendsqr system.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
